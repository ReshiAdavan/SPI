# SPI

At some point in my career, I thought to challenge myself by creating something other than a full-stack project in an entirely new programming language. Coincidentally, this was also when I started to hear about newer programming languages - Rust, Go, etc. 

So through passionate research and learning, I dove into the realm of programming languages, interpreters vs compilers, etc., and I thought the perfect challenge would be to create an interpreter in python (a lang I never used before) for a programming language. Which one in particular? One of the oldest ones to exist - Pascal.

### Features

- Simple to use. Just run SPI in a command terminal along with a pascal file. 

### Skills

- Programming languages: Python
- Other: Recursion, Data Structures and Algorithms
